# Carbon-Dioxide-Producers
This is an interactive web map showing the top ten carbon dioxide producers in the world in 2016. These are the top producers based on net emissions, but the map also shows the countries per capita emissions.
On mouseover, the country is highlighted in a different color. When the marker for each country is clicked, a pop up will show that country's name as well as their net and per capita emissions.
The basemap was uploaded from leaflet, and the data obtained from Worldometers.
